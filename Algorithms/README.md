# Tic-Tac-Toe Game
This Python program allows you to play a game of Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as XOX. Players take turns placing their X or O symbols on the board's empty cells. The game is won by a player placing three X's or three O's vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.

## Features
- Supports two players.
- Tracks scores throughout multiple rounds.
- Prints the board after each move.
- Validates user input to ensure it's within the board range and the selected cell is not already occupied.


## Usage
```bash
   python tic_tac_toe.py
   ```

## How to Play
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Navigate to the directory containing the game files.
- Run the tic_tac_toe.py file using Python.
- Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.
- Each player takes turns selecting a cell on the board to place their symbol (X or O).
- The game ends when one player wins, or if there's a tie.
- After the game ends, players' names and the number of games they've won are displayed.
- If a player wins three times, the game ends, and the winning player is declared.
